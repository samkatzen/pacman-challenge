# pacman-challenge
My task in this activity is to create a pacman on demand (button click) and move these pacmen across the page.
My code is marked in the file

To use this challenge all you need to do is click the add pac man button as many times as you would like then press the start button. You will start to see the Pac Man moving around the screen.

Some future improvements I could add to this challenge would be add a slow down button, increase speed button, and a stop button.
